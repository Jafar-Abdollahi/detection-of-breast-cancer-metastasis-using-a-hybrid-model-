# detection-of-breast-cancer-metastasis-using-a-hybrid-model
Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent disease and major cause of mortality among women worldwide. A substantial number of BC patients experience metastasis which in turn leads to treatment failure and death. The survival rate has been significantly increased thanks to the state of the art technologies and detection tools. In this study, we cross-compared the application of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Discrete Cosine Transform, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, and Ensemble to diagnose BC metastasis. We further combined MLP with genetic algorithm (GA) as a hybrid method of intelligent analysis. The core data we used for comparison belonged to the images of both benign and malignant tumors and were taken from Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI repository. Our findings indicate that our MLP-GA hybrid algorithm can speed up diagnosis with higher accuracy rate than the individual patterns of algorithm. Two methods of comparison (Cross-Validation and Holdout) were applied to this study which produced consistent results.
